problem with white space on right hand side - <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4617872/white-space-showing-up-on-right-side-of-page-when-background-image-should-extend>

first tried inspect and found that if i scrolled up and down the white space, only .flavou-text items were highlighting so i thought it was something to do with this, tried combos and nothing. Online fix.
